***1. Introduction***
*********************
Breath of Fire is one of my favorite games and I decided to make a 
walkthrough for it. This game may be old, but to any true rpg gamer 
it's a must play. I suggest playing this game if you liked the Final 
Fantasy series. This guide is now almost done. All I have left to do is 
Have you played Breath of Fire?

YES
NO
the item list.

***3. Version History***
************************
Version 1.6 (6/7/03)- This guide is almost 1 years old. Anyway I 
finished up the items section and finished the weapon section. All that 
is left is the armor section and this guide is done.

Version 1.5 (2/27/03)- This guide is now complete. What is next to come 
you ask. I still need to put up the item, weapon, armor and many more 
sections. This overall guide is not even close to done. I am working on 
it so don't worry.

Version 1.4 (2/24/03)- The guide is now 90% done. The next update 
should be with the finishing of the guide.

Version 1.3 (2/21/03)- Haven't looked at this guide in a while, but 
today I worked on the walkthrough some more. Its almost 70% done now. I 
know I still have much work to do.

Version 1.2 (11/3/02)- I haven't updated in a while, but the 
walkthrough is developing nicely. I am almost done with it and it's 
very thorough and complete. Soon I will finish everything like I 
promised.

Version 1.1 (10/02/02)- Huge Update. I got more then halfway done with 
my walkthrough. I started a little on my character section, but this 
walkthrough is not even 40% done. It is almost ready for submission.

Version 1.0 (9/24/02)- Started the FAQ. Every single section is 
incomplete and I am now starting on the walkthrough. Bear with me 
people it's a long way before its done.

****************************
***5. Info about the game***
****************************
Breath of Fire is different from other rpg games and you will soon see 
the difference once the first battle starts. The reason for this is 
because that monster has hp bars that you can see to tell how much hp 
they have left. The gameplay is pretty easy and not too complicated to 
understand. This rpg game is not too hard to beat. Gaining levels is 
pretty hard, but you don't have to be too high of a level to beat the 
game. Anyway on to the walkthrough.

*******************
***6. Characters***
*******************
These are the ratings for the characters. They will not be numerical, 
but will be in words. They are my own opinion. This section will cover 
how good or bad their attack, defense and all their stats are. It will 
also list their special abilities.

Ryu: Ryu is the hero of this game. He uses a sword most of the time, 
unless you are using the boomerang. He is the typical hero and is a 
very good character. He will be in your party about 90% of the time and 
is one of the best characters in the game. His Dragon skills are very 
good and you will soon realize the rating for him. He however levels up 
slowly later on, but his he will get strong weapons and armor so this 
is not too much of a hindrance.
------------------------
HP: Good
MP: Average
Strength: Awesome
Vigor: Good
Agility: Good
Wisdom: Average
Luck: Good
------------------------
Special Abilities: Fishing/Dragon Skills

Ryu can fish where you can see little fishes jumping for gold, but you 
won't use this skill as much as you would in Breath of Fire 2. His 
second ability makes up for this mediocre skill. However, you will need 
the fishing ability to get his best equipment later on in the game.

Ryu can turn into different types of Dragons and this ability is 
awesome. He will fill his HP bar to full no matter what and his later 
Dragons are very, very powerful. Agne his ultimate Dragon does 999 
damage per hit. This skill is very nice.
 
Overall: 9.5/10

Nina: Nina is the healer in this game. She will be the second character 
you get in the game. Almost 90% of her magic spells are oriented to 
curing or defensive magic. She is a necessity against bosses and a must 
for your party. She has a pitiful attack, but her defense isn't too 
bad. Her spells are a must to beat certain bosses.
------------------------
HP: Bad
MP: Awesome
Strength: Pathetic
Vigor: Average
Agility: Good
Wisdom: Awesome
Luck: Good
------------------------
Special Abilities: Flying

Nina later on in the game can turn into a huge white bird that flies 
everywhere on the map. If you are flying you can not be attacked and 
you need it to get some special equipment. Although it is a pretty good 
ability, her Warp spell is faster to travel from town to town. 

Overall: 8/10

Bo: Bo is a wolf that can shoot arrows. He is pretty good, but he will 
probably be fused with Karn so you won't use him much later on. During 
the beginning of the game, however, Bo is a very good character. He has 
a good attack, but his defense sucks. He has high HP though and his Fry 
spell is very good against early bosses. Later on in the game, he gets 
pretty much useless and only good to fuse with Karn.
------------------------
HP: Awesome
MP: Bad
Strength: Good
Vigor: Awesome
Agility: Good
Wisdom: Bad
Luck: Pathetic
------------------------
Special Abiltity: Hunting

Bo can walk through trees as though they did not exist and this is 
needed to get into some parts of the story. He can also shoot his bow 
while you are walking and get some antlers or meat. It can be amusing 
to see him shoot once in a while. 

Overall: 6/10

Karn: Karn is the thief of your group. If you put him in front of your 
party then he will pick treasure chests and disarm the traps. He can 
also pick locks (duh he is a thief). He is not really strong attack 
wise, but once he learns his special abilities, man he is really good.
------------------------
HP: Average
MP: Average
Strength: Average
Vigor: Good
Agility: Awesome
Wisdom: Average
Luck: Awesome
------------------------
Special Ability: Pick locks

Karn can disarm traps on the treasure chests so you an avoid the bad 
effects that comes out from it.

Overall: 8.5/10

Gobi: Gobi is not a very good character in my opinion. He is slow and 
his defense is not even all that good. He is only good for fusing with 
Karn. His abilities are very good underwater and he is a key character 
for traveling further on in this game. However, above water he is not 
too good. He can do business in a store in Prima, but the chance of 
getting something good is not too good.
------------------------
HP: Good
MP: Average
Strength: Good
Vigor: Average
Agility: Average
Wisdom: Average
Luck: Average
------------------------
Special Ability: Turn into a big fish

Gobi can turn into a huge fish underwater to travel. You can not be 
attacked by enemies in this state and it's the quickest and fastest way 
to travel underwater. It is a pretty useful ability.

Ox: This huge guy will join your party and will be a pretty good 
addition. Personally I just use him to fuse with Karn, but he can be 
pretty good. He has a nice attack and defense, but his agility is 
something to laugh at. He is not a bad character overall. He just is 
not my favorite.
------------------------
HP: Awesome
MP: Average
Strength: Awesome
Defense: Good
Vigor: Average
Agility: Pathetic
Wisdom: Average
Luck: Average
------------------------
Special Ability: Beat-down

This special ability lets you break down rocks and you need this 
ability to get some nice items. It is not the best skill, however.

Bleu: She is the only offensive spell caster you will get in this game. 
Her spells are designed to take out groups of enemies quickly and 
efficiently. If you want to make this game a bit easier then I suggest 
taking Bleu, because she is one of the best characters you will ever 
get. Later on in the game her spells will devastate enemies, but she is 
a bit weakened against bosses, still useful nonetheless.
 
------------------------
HP: Bad
MP: Awesome
Strength: Pathetic
Defense: Average
Vigor: Average
Agility: Awesome
Wisdom: Awesome
Luck: Good
------------------------
Special Ability: None

Mogu: This mole is a pretty decent member of your party. I always seem 
to never use him though. He gains levels pretty quickly, but will have 
low attack and defense. His HP is quite good for a little guy (no 
offense). 

------------------------
HP: Awesome
MP: N/A
Strength: Average
Defense: Average
Vigor: Average
Agility: Good
Wisdom: Average
Luck: Average
------------------------
Special Ability: Dig

Mogu can dig at dragon head places for items or at sandy areas. Pretty 
useful, and he is needed to get some important items in this game.

********************
***7. Walkthrough***
********************

********** 
**Drogen**
**********
Items: V Potion, 300 GP
New Armor/Weapons: Yes
Level: 1
You wake up in a burning building and an old lady is telling you to 
move. Search the huge chest for a V Potion and head out with her. When 
you head down talk to everyone to continue the story. Watch the rest of 
the intro and at the end you will get 300 GP as a gift. After you 
receive the gold head out of the building and go to your left. There 
will be a man selling equipment. Buy an armpad and leave the town. 
Train until you are level 3 before you go really far, because the 
monsters are pretty hard. The old lady heals you for free so go to her 
if you need healing. Once you are level 3 head north until you see a 
huge castle. Head in.

********** 
**Camlon**
**********
Items: None
New Armor/Weapons: No
Level: 3
Just head into the castle, because there really is not much to do in 
this town. Before you head in I suggest you buy a couple of herbs and 
antidotes.

*****************
**Camlon Castle**
***************** 
Items: 5 Herbs, 290GP, Bronze Sword, Gauntlet, Visor, 2 Antidotes 
Level: 6
This dungeon like place is not really a maze. You should explore every 
bit of it before going. I suggest staying near a healing spring and 
leveling up to at least 6 before heading out. You will thank me later. 
If you get lost in this place... then you really need to sharpen your 
skills, because this is a basic dungeon. At the end of the dungeon you 
will see a fat frog. He will be your first boss fight so be ready to 
face a boss. Heal you HP to full and then talk to him. If your at least 
level 6 then he will be easy.

******** 
**Frog**
******** 
This is the first boss you have to fight. If you did like I said and 
leveled to 6 then you should be laughing at this boss fight. The Frog 
will attack first so watch for your HP in case it gets too low. Then 
all you have to do is continue to do regular attacks until it gets its 
second wind. Then after a couple of more hits the Frog should go down. 
He is one of the easier bosses. If you don't have any herbs, however, 
you will lose this fight. 
EXP: 500
Gold: 350
Item: Fire Stone 

All the monsters in the castle will be gone now so don't worry about 
having to face any more battles. Head out of the castle and the King 
will talk about a quake control. After he finishes talking buy more 
herbs/antidotes if you need it and head north then east to another 
town. You will not be able to go in the town until it becomes night so 
hang outside the town until it becomes dark. I suggest you just fight 
monsters for a bit. When it becomes night head into the town.

*********
**Nanai**
*********
Items: 300 gold, S. Potion, 2 Herbs
New Weapon/Armor: Yes
Level: 8
You can not use into the inn or the item shop. However, head into the 
inn and search the chest for the S. Potion. If you get too close to the 
guards they will throw you out of town so be careful. You can go into 
the weapon shop but it is very expensive so you will probably not be 
able to afford it. Head into the huge building and get ready to go 
through another dungeon like area.

*****************
**Nanai Dungeon**
*****************
Items: 1 Antidote, 720 GP, B Stone, Armpad, F Stone, Cure
Just collect all the items especially the Stones, as it will come be 
very useful. After you are done head down the set of stairs. The second 
level of this dungeon is pretty similar to the first one. It is very 
much the same and just collect the items and continue. If you are level 
8 like you supposed to be then this dungeon's monsters are easy and you 
shouldn't have any trouble whatsoever. Head down the stairs once more 
and you will be in a different room. Prepare for a decent boss fight. 
Heal your HP to full before you go in and prepare.

**********
**Knight**
********** 
Big step up in difficulty then the last boss. His T. Bolt spell does 20 
damage to your character. His regular attacks only do 9-10 damage so do 
not worry about those. The advantage you have is that you are faster 
then he is. Save you B and F Stones for now until he gets to about half 
HP. Then let hell break loose and deal a combined attack of 120 damage 
by using the Stones. After he gets his second wind then continue to 
attack him and he should fall. If you are below level 8 then I feel 
sorry for you. Also if you are not stocked with at least 9 Herbs then I 
suggest you go back and get some, because you will lose without them. 
After his HP starts to get low he will start using Recover and that can 
become VERY annoying. Continue to attack him and heal when necessary is 
my only advice. 

After you beat the Knight talk to the machine and take out the key. 
Then step on a blue circle and you will be transported out of the town 
and the town will be destroyed. You are back at Camlon and talk to King 
then head out and go back to Nanai. You will see that it is ruined. 
Head in a northeast direction to find another town.

**********
**Windia**
**********
Items: V. Potion, Suede Shield, Suede Hat, 4 Herbs, 2 Antidote
New Weapons/Armor: Yes
Level: 9
You can find the V. Potion at the Red house. Nothing much else to do. 
You can buy a chain mail for Ryu if you want, but it is not necessary 
as you won't be playing with him for a while. Head to the castle and 
talk to the woman in the gown. She will tell Ryu that the King is not 
available right now and tells him to go to sleep. Now you are in 
control of Nina so walk around the castle getting the various items. 
After you are done head out of the castle and head for the weapon 
store. You can buy Nina a Bronze Rapier but it is not necessary. I 
suggest you get a Suede Gown and trade in the dress. After you are done 
shopping head out and go to the cave west of the town.

*************
**Aura Cave**
*************
Items: Cure, Suede Gown, 220 GP, I. Ore, 2 Herb, B. Stone, C. Stone
Level: 7
When you enter 2 guards will say that they will escort you. Say yes and 
they will join your party. They have a good attack and since Nina has a 
horrid attack it is a good thing. This cave is not very long. Just make 
sure you get every single treasure box. I. Ore is a necessary item to 
continue the game. Gain at least 2 levels for Nina here and it won't 
take too long. After you are done head out and you will see a town west 
of the cave. At least get Nina to level 6.. if 7 seems to hard for you.

**********
**Romero**
********** 
Items: L. Potion, Protein B, Map
New Weapons/Armor: Yes
Level: 7
Go to the weapons section of the town and buy Nina a Silk Gown. It will 
come with a hefty price so be prepared to pay for it. It will be worth 
it as here defense will rise greatly. Go to the various houses looking 
for items. You will find the map in a house that has a hole in the 
middle. Push the bottles. You will understand what I'm saying once you 
see it. You will hear about a wizard kidnapping girls from the town... 
pervert... Anyway head out the town the east direction and go into the 
forest. The forest is exactly straight east from outside the town. If 
you have problems finding it...

****************
**Karma Forest**
****************
Items: Bandage, 2 Herbs, 150 GP
Level: 7
Get Nina to level 7 here at least. I prefer you level her to 8 because 
it will be easier. The monsters here are not hard. Just have Nina use 
the E-Key and it will do 30 damage to all enemies and then the soldiers 
will do mop-up. Easy place to level up and you should take full 
advantage of it. Anyway after you are done head east and out of the 
forest.

*************** 
**Karma Tower**
***************
Items: 2 M. Drop, 3 Herbs, 2 Charm, 2 Cure, Life2 
Level: 8
Right when you enter if you head a bit to the right you will see a 
phantom like monster holding a huge reaper. Before you battle him drink 
from the fountain then talk to the Phantom to engage your 3rd boss 
fight.

*********
**Morte**
*********
Wow he is the easiest boss fight you will probably ever have. Just have 
Nina use the E. Key and have the soldiers attack. His attack will only 
do 10 damage and is pathetic. His second wind isn't that much 
difference and one more hit from the E. Key will finish him. Nina 
should level to 8 in this battle.

Continue and search everywhere for treasure chests. This tower is 
pretty long and you might get lost in some places. You will see another 
phantom holding a reaper and get ready for a pretty tough boss fight. 
This boss is a lot harder then the previous. Heal up and talk to it. 

********** 
**Mortea**
**********
I suggest casting Fort immediately on Nina then on Soldier 2 then 
Soldier 1. During the time Nina cast Fort make Soldier 1 use E. Key and 
Soldier 2 attack. Then use Attack Up on both of the Soldiers. After 
that have Nina use E. Key and heal when necessary and attack regularly 
with the soldiers. Mortea should fall quickly after that. 

After defeating her head up the stairs. Head right and go up the 
stairs. Save by the dragon and heal by the Spring. Then open up the 
purple door and step on the steps. The Wizard will use some gas and the 
birdpeople are helpless because of it. You will engage the Wizard in a 
battle, but you were supposed to lose it on purpose. The soldier will 
escape and go for help. This is where Ryu comes in. Join the rescue 
party outside and get ready to fight the Wizard.

***********************
**Karma Tower (again)**
***********************
Items: Remedy, Rang
Level: 9
Head to where the Wizard was last time. Ryu isn't affected by the gas. 
Get the items and prepare to fight the Wizard.

**********
**Wizard**
**********
The Wizard will use T. Bolt and Freeze. They do about 10-15 damage so 
you don't have to worry too much. He will get the first attack and just 
use the E. Key to deal 30 damage every turn. Keep your HP when it 
starts to fall and he shouldn't be that hard... If you keep continuing 
this order then the Wizard will fall pretty easily.

Ryu should level after this battle and he takes Nina out of this place 
and they get a ride back to the castle. The King gets revived by the 
Remedy and Nina joins your party. You can now head out the east side of 
the town. Go down the stairs from the King's chambers and in the 
northeast section of the lower floor is a stair leading down. From 
there go south then east then talk to the guards. Ignore the treasure 
chests as you can not get them yet. Head in a southeast direction and 
go into the first town.

**********
**Tantar**
********** 
Items: Charm, W Ptn.
Level: 9
New Weapons/Armor: Yes
You can buy some new weapons and armor for both Nina and Ryu. Now head 
south and go into the house that has smoke coming out of the roof. Head 
inside and give the man your I. Ore and he will make you a saw. There 
is nothing much else to do in this town so head out and go to the town 
east of this one. 

********** 
**Tuntar**
********** 
Items: Herb, Cure 
Level: 9
New Weapons/Armor: No
Stock up on some herbs, acorns here and now we need to gain some major 
levels. Head out of the town. Go in a north west direction until you 
see a clump of trees and a little opening. Go near it and Ryu will use 
the saw but it breaks. You can now head in the forest. This place is 
great to level up. First have Nina use the E. Key and have Ryu use the 
Rang to hit multigroups of enemies. I suggest getting lots of levels 
here.

********************* 
**Forest of Despair**
********************* 
Items: Herb, 2 T. Drop, Life, Wrist 
Level: 11
Once Nina reaches level 11 head into the building. You should have been 
training in these woods. There really is not much else to do, but get 
lots of experience points.

************ 
**Fortress**
************
Items: 2 Life, 3 T. Drop, Long Sword, 5 Herb, Life2, Acorn, Wolf Hat,   
Level: 11
Heal up and get ready to start off with a semi-boss fight. The only 
thing you have to do to beat them is to attack with the Rang with Ryu 
and use the E. Key with Nina. They don't have a second wind and this 
battle should be really easy. There will be traps on the ground, so 
watch out where you are going. Soon you will see more guards. Use the 
same strategy as last time to beat them. (They are really easy). 
Continue through this dungeon and you will see 3 guards instead of 2. 
Fight them using the same strategy as before. The old man Chief will 
ask you to take their weapons, say yes and he will take you and set a 
trap for you. Here is a real boss fight.

*******
**Pog**
*******
Pog isn't hard, just first use Fort on Ryu then Nina. After that cast 
Attack up on Ryu and continue attacking Pog. Have Nina use the E. Key 
and soon Pog will die. He gives lots of exp and gold and is one of the 
easier bosses.
EXP: 1400
Gold: 800

Soon an Archer will come and rescue you and the fake Chief is revealed 
as a General. Get ready for yet another boss fight.

*********** 
**General**
*********** 
The General hits pretty hard, but with Bo's Fry spell he should be very 
easy to beat. First have Nina cast fort on everyone. Have Bo use his 
Fry spell and have the Ryu use the E. Key. Then have Nina use the E. 
Key and after Bo runs out of AP have him attack and Ryu should attack 
as well. The General should die pretty fast.
EXP: 1500
Gold: 1300

Head back to the 2 towns after you are done. I suggest you go to the 
Forest of Despair and start to level up Bo and have Nina at level 13. 
You will learn the reason why. Anyway Bo is only level 9, so get him to 
at least level 11 or 12. Head to Tantur and talk to the chief. He will 
talk about going to Agua and this is how you get there. If you trained 
Nina to level 13 then use Warp and teleport to Romero, but if you don't 
have Bo in front of your party and follow the trail going in a 
northeast direction. Bo can walk through forest. 

*****************
**Romero (again**
*****************
Items: Look in previous Romero section
New Weapons/Armor: No
Level: 13 
If you come here at night then there will be Zombies running around. 
The town obviously has a big zombie problem. If you talk to chief in 
the top right corner then he will tell you to rid the zombies and he 
will tell you about Agua. Come back at night and talk to the old lady 
and her husband will open up a tomb and you can get a water jar in 
there. You will need it later. In order for him to open up the tomb you 
must talk to everyone who is not a zombie in this town. Head out of the 
town.

Head in a southeast direction until you see a cave. Head into the cave 
and prepare to get some Cleansing Water.

************************
**Cleansing Water Cave**
************************
Items: 2 Herb, Nice Hat, F. Stone, T. Drop, Bronze Hat, Apple   
Level: 14
This dungeon is not at all hard to navigate through. The monsters are 
pretty easy and the dungeon is short. Just get every treasure chest, 
because some of them are really useful. At the bottom go to bottom of 
the stairs into the water and press A and the jar will fill up with 
water and you will teleport back to Romero.

***************** 
**Chief's House**
***************** 
Items: Antidote, 900 GP, Herb, Cure, Tablet
The Chief will talk about Agua and how you need the tablet in order to 
enter. Take all the treasure boxes especially the tablet. If you want 
you can go back to the cave and fill up the water jar, because it is an 
automatic healing item. It will heal full HP and MP. You can refill any 
time, but if you don't want to then head west of Romero into a huge 
floating tower. That is Agua. Make sure you buy Bo a chain mail in this 
town.

******** 
**Agua**
********
Items: Life2, Acorn, Apple, 2 Herb, Sun Hat, Iron Shield, Theif CL, 
Acorn, Hairband, Bracelelet,      
Level: 14
Ryu will read the inscription on the tablet and a huge floating tower 
will come down. Enter it. You will not be able to get a lot of treasure 
in this tower so don't worry about it. You will have to come back later 
after you have required some more characters. In the second floor head 
down the platform on the first one. Then head to the one on the bottom 
right and get the iron shield. Repeat, but this time head for the 
bottom left. Then head down and go on the platform. Head up the stairs. 
One the other floors just board the platforms etc, until you reach a 
room that has like a shining pillar in the middle. Get ready for a boss 
fight. Go up to it and touch it.
 
******** 
**Wisp**
********
The Wisp is a pretty hard boss. Start the fight off by casting Fort on 
everyone starting with Bo. Then have Bo use his Fry spell have Nina 
cast attack-up on Ryu and then have Ryu attack. After that is done Nina 
should use the E. Key, have Bo use Fry and have Ryu attack. Wisp has no 
second wind so he will fall after the first try.
EXP: 1200
Gold: 300

After you are done start heading down the tower once more. It will be 
easier going down then going up. After you are done head back to the 
town of Tantar. From Tuntar follow the path heading north until you see 
a huge robot. Go in the robot.

************** 
**Huge Robot**
**************
Items: Herb, Bronze Hat, Acorn, Life2, Marble1, 
Level: 15 
Just head up the flight of stairs and get the treasure chests. Soon you 
will see a General and 2 Lancers. Talk to them to initiate a boss 
fight. 

********************* 
**2 Lancers/General**
*********************
This battle is not too hard. Just have Ryu use the Rang to hit all 3 of 
them. Have Nina use the E. Key and have Bo Fry one of the lancers then 
Fry the General from then on. They should fall in 3-4 turns max. This 
battle also gives a nice number of Exp and Gold.
EXP: 1873
Gold: 650 

Talk to the heart shaped object and the Giant will turn on. Head to the 
blue circle on the top left of the heart and step on it. Ignore the 
blue circle on top of it or else you will be taken back to the 
beginning. Follow the pattern of the blue circles and you will soon be 
taken to a control room. It will look like the block when you got the 
E. Key. Activate it and watch the little cinema scene. 

************************** 
**Chief's House (Tantar)**
************************** 
Items: Herb, Key
Go to the chief's house in Tantar and talk to him. He will move his 
chari and tell you that the Ring is in a cave upstream and that the key 
is below. Get the key and head for the cave that is next to the Giant 
Robot.

******************** 
**Cave of the Ring**
******************** 
Items: W. Ptn, Life, Life2, 2000 GP, Herb, Acorn, Sky Shield, Ring   
Level: 15
The first cave/dungeon is a short cave and there are no monsters in it. 
Just get the W. Ptn and head out for the other cave. If you talk to the 
door it will open up with your key. Head down the flight of stairs. 
This cave has easy monsters, so don't worry about dying. It is like a 
maze, however, and you should be able to figure it out easily. After 
you get the ring I suggest you equip it on Ryu. It will upper his 
attack by 10. Step on the blue circle once you are done and you will go 
back to the gate. Return to Tantar. 

Go in the Chief's House and the wedding ceremony will start. After they 
kiss and blah, blah, blah then leave the town. Someone stole the Robot 
during the wedding ceremony. It will destroy Tuntar, but it will refuse 
to destroy Tantar. 

***************************** 
**Giant Stone Robot (again)**
*****************************
Level: 15
The monsters in here are harder. The next boss fight will be on the 
hardest you will fight. Just navigate your way through like you did 
last time and get ready for a tough boss fight.

*********** 
**Gremlin**
***********
This boss is pretty hard. Start by casting Fort on everyone starting 
with Bo, then Nina, then Ryu. Have Bo use Fry during this process. The 
hero should use the E. Key. After Nina is done using Fort then have her 
cast Attack Up on Ryu. Then use Fry with Bo, attack with Hero, and have 
Nina either use the E. Key or heal. When Bo runs out of MP then use an 
acorn to bring it back up. If you use this process, you should be fine. 
Gremlin has a 1 hit attack and a all party hit attack. If you just 
can't seem to beat him then I suggest you level up to at least level 15 
before you try to beat him. His second wind is very nasty. He hits all 
party members for major HP and he has a bunch of life. This battle is 
hard so remember if you just can't seem to beat him then level up.
EXP: 1400 
Gold: 600

After that really tough battle you will see a scene where the Giant 
Robot kills himself. Head south to a small shrine right below the 
Volcano. Head in and get ready to get the first out of Ryu's Dragon 
powers. 

******************** 
**#1 Dragon Shrine**
******************** 
Items: Melon
Level: 16
Only Ryu will be able to enter. First heal by the pool, then get the 
Melon. Then get ready to fight a 1 on 1 boss fight and if you win you 
will be able to use mighty dragon moves.

********* 
**Talon**
********* 
In this battle you should use the E. Key, because that will do more 
then Ryu can do regularly. Since the E. Key's damage doesn't matter 
where you are, position Ryu in the back row. This way he can take 
minimum damage while dealing decent damage. Start the battle and start 
to use the E. Key. Heal with herbs if necessary and this battle should 
not be too hard. Talon has no second attack so once you beat him its 
over. You will get dragon powers after this battle.
EXP: 400 
Gold: 190

After you are done head out of the shrine and continue south. With Bo 
head into the cave. 

***************** 
**Cave to Auria**
*****************
Items: None 
Level: 16
This cave is short and soon it will be over. After you leave the cave, 
head into the town that is by the sea.

********* 
**Auria**
*********
Items: Prison Cl, S. Ptn, Life2, Life, Cure, W. Ant, V. Ptn, Life, 4000 
GP, Marble1, L. Ptn, Marble3, Cure, Smart RG, Acorn, Life, Antidote, 
Cure, G. Tiara,    
Level: 16
New Weapons/Armor: Yes
Right when you enter the town you will be arrested for absolutely no 
reason. You will end up in a prison cell with a guy sleeping in a bed. 
If you talk to him he will open the door for you. Search the water 
bucket for a Prison Cl. Then leave the jail cell. Watch out for the 
guards, but make your way through the town avoiding the guards. Make 
sure you buy new weapons and armor at the weapon shop. Stock up on 
herbs if you need it. In one of the houses an old man will ask to talk 
to Nina. Switch the party so she is on top and talk to the old man. Say 
yes when he says fix his back and he will give u 20,000 free gold after 
your done. That's a lot of gold. 

After you are done looting the houses, head to the dock and talk to the 
captain. He will tell you that Ross owns the ship. Head to top-most 
house and talk to him. Before you talk to him loot his treasure. (And 
we call ourselves heroes... so ironic);) Talk to Ross and he will tell 
you help him and he will lend you his ship. Ok before we continue with 
the story we need a Gold Bar. The Gold Bar is very, very expensive. It 
is 65,000 GP. In order to buy it at Auria you might have to do several 
things to amass such a huge amount of gold. First buy a vitamin from 
the item shop and go upstairs and give it to the hiccupping man. He 
will give u 5,000 GP. In one of the houses an old man will ask for a 
massage. This will give u another 20,000 GP. Then finally you can save 
a boy from the faeries for another 20,000 GP. First talk to the mother 
then go to the faerie area. (It is in the woods right below the Dragon 
Shrine). Talk to the boy running around in circles. Return to Auria and 
talk to the mother she will tell you save him. Then talk to the boy. 
Not too hard. Sell the G. Tiara in Ross's house for another 13,000 GP. 
You should be set by now. Now head east to another cave.

***************** 
**Cave to Bleak**
*****************
Items: Cure, Shell Hat 
Level: 16
Don't worry about getting the treasure and just try to get yourself 
out. It is not too hard.

********* 
**Bleak**
********* 
Items: 4 Herbs, Life, W. Ant
Level: 19
New Weapons/Armor: Yes
You can get the treasure and talk to the chief in the top house and he 
will give you an icicle. Don't sleep in the inn unless you have a pouch 
because the innkeeper will steal money from you. This is a great place 
to level up. Go outside and fight the Gold Slimes for major experience 
and gold. Get up to at least level 19 preferably 20.

Head to the cave south of the Bleak and enter it. This cave is so short 
and has no treasure in it so I am not going to make a section for it. 
Anyway head out and you will use the icicle to head out into a desert. 
Head into a town called Arad.

******** 
**Arad**
********  
Items: Fife
Level: 20
New Weapons/Armor: No
Just rest at the inn for free then save your game. Then head up to the 
chief and he will tell you to destroy the sandworm and in return you 
will get the Fife. Agree with his terms and the game will turn to 
night. Head out and get ready to fight the sandworm.

************ 
**Sandworm**
************
Ok first turn. Have Bo use Fry spell and have Nina start casting Fort 
on herself then Bo then Ryu. If you are level 20 like I said you should 
be then this boss fight is a joke. Have Ryu turn into a Thunder Dragon. 
Second turn have Bo use Fry have Nina cast Fort and have Ryu attack. 
When Nina cast Fort on everyone have her use the E. Key or heal and use 
items. She should also cast Attack up on Bo. There is no need to cast 
this one Ryu, because it does not increase his attack. This boss fight 
should be over real quick.
EXP: 1200 
Gold: 1200

Heal at the inn and head south to a weird looking pyramid. Use the fife 
on the square and head on in. 

********* 
**Krypt**
********* 
Items: 2 Skull Hats, 3 Herbs, Headgear, Cure, 2 Life, Icy Hat, 
Antidote, Dream RG, Iron Shield, Dagger, Hunt Cl, Book 
Level: 20
If you come up on any treasure chests beat them, because they give real 
nice EXP. You can fall down many places so watch out. Make your way 
southeast using the corner so you don't fall down. Then head down the 
stairs. Don't pick up the chest because the person in front will die. 
There is a B. Rang in the Rock, but you can't break it yet. You will be 
able to later. Head up to the weird eye thing and talk to it to start 
another boss fight. 

*********** 
**Eye Spy**
*********** 
Start out like a usual boss fight. Use Thunder Dragon with Ryu and have 
Bo use Fry. Nina should cast Fort on herself then Bo then Ryu. Then 
have her use attack up on Bo and then either heal or use the E. Key. 
This boss fight is not very hard at all. Just use this strategy and it 
should be easy. You will notice that as the boss fight drags on the 
more you damage the Eye Spy the eyes start to disappear. Once his HP 
starts to get low he will use T. Bolt. That will hit all party members 
for 25 damage. If you are not at least level 20 then you will have a 
hard time. 
EXP: 2800
Gold: 2800

Head out of the Krypt using Karn in front of your party to pick all the 
locks. Head out and go to Bleak. Upgrade your equipment if you have to 
and then head for Winlan.

****************** 
**Winlan (again)**
****************** 
Head for the treasure chests in the lower part of the castle and using 
Karn get all the treasure. Equip your new goodies head out and go to 
Romero. You will soon learn why.

******** 
**Agua**
******** 
Items: Life Armor, Icy DR, Flame Shield
Level: 22
The reason we are coming back is, because there are very, very powerful 
armor/weapon here and we want them. They will greatly assist in us in 
the future battles. I suggest going up and getting all the treasure. 
Have Karn in front and it should be very easy. Search the dragon 
statues to get the Life AR and other powerful items. With all these 
items Ryu will not easily now... Kind of unfair. 

Ok this part is optional, but you are going to need another Gold Bar so 
lets go get one. Go to the Cave leading to Bleak and pick all the locks 
with Karn and get a Gold Bar. This way you won't have to get 65,000 
gold all over again. Its optional, but hey I would do this. After we 
are done head to Bleak and rest up and get ready. Head for the tower 
that is west of Bleak and head in.

*********************
**Tower of Darkness**
*********************
Items: B Stone, Life, Life2, Herb, Cure, Horn Hat, Turban, 4000 GP  
Level: 22
Navigate your way through this tower and it shouldn't be too hard. 
Choppers might cause some problem, but they will target Ryu and if he 
has the Life Armor then it should not be a problem. Get all the items 
and head for the to and you will see a pillar. Talk to the Pillar to 
activate a boss fight.

********* 
**Cloud**
********* 
Cloud is an all-spell enemy using boss. He will only use spells and his 
most damaging one is the 3.5 spell which is what the E. Key does, but a 
bit stronger. Have Nina cast Attack up on Karn and Bo, but don't do on 
Ryu. Then have her either heal or attack. Keep your HP up and you 
should be fine. Have Karn attack regularly, have Bo attack or use Fry. 
Ryu should turn into a Thunder Dragon and attack. Cloud has no second 
wind so that's a relief.
EXP: 4800  
Gold: 1200

Search the pillar for a Dark Key and then head down. Talk to the old 
man and he will give you a mirror. Head out and go to Bleak and heal 
up. After this head to Auria and its time to help the girl. We had to 
do all that crap to save some girl... how ridiculous.

********* 
**Auria**
********* 
Items: Dart, 5 Herb, B Stone, Metal Shield, F Stone, Light Key
Level: 23
Head to Ross's House and go save her daughter. Have Karn pick all the 
locks and talk to her. You will use the mirror and his dead wife will 
show up and talk to him. Bad translation... peace omg... squaresoft can 
do better then this. Anyway go talk to the daughter again. She will ask 
you to help her so say yes. Head to the top and get the Light Key. Head 
for the harbor and talk to the stupid General for another boss fight.

*********** 
**General**
*********** 
Have Ryu turn into a Thunder Dragon. Then kill the Archer by using Bo's 
Fry spell and have Karn attack the Archer. Nina should be casting Fort 
on everyone then Attack up on Karn and Bo. After that she should just 
heal. Casting Fort on Ryu will have no effect so don't. Then just heal 
and attack and this battle should end pretty fast.
EXP: 4370 
Gold: 2835

After you defeat them they will destroy the ship. You should have a 
Gold Bar by now, so trade Gobi the Gold Bar for the Gun Powder. Now 
head for the cave that you came through to even get to Auria. There go 
to the section where there are rocks and blast it. Start walking down 
the path and you will fight some Spearmen and Archers but they are not 
too much trouble to beat. There will be a boss fight soon, just to let 
you know. 

********* 
**Squid**
********* 
Start the boss fight like any other. Have Nina cast Fort on everyone 
but Ryu. Then have Ryu turn into a Thunder Dragon. Bo should use Fry 
and Karn should attack. Nina should then cast attack up on Bo and Karn 
and then heal or attack. This boss fight should not be too hard at all 
if you are a decent level. 
EXP: 7804 
Gold: 5463

Get all the treasure then head back to Auria and talk to the captain. 
Then set sail, but sure enough get ready for another boss fight. First 
however you will fight 2 archers and 1 lancer. Get rid of them quickly 
and then you will have to fight the General.

******** 
**Octo**
********
Start this boss fight like the last time. Nina should cast Fort, and 
Ryu should turn into a Thunder Dragon. Bo should Fry and have Karn 
attack. Have Bo keep his AP up and have Nina heal after she casts Fort. 
It is another pretty easy boss fight.
EXP: 7218 
Gold: 1804

You will end up on a little island and Gobi will tell you that you need 
gills. He says he will go down and get the gills himself after taking 
some money... that criminal.

********* 
**Prima**
********* 
Items: Tide Hat
Level: 23
New Weapons/Armor: Yes
Talk to the guild master in Prima and he will tell you that there are 
no gills in Prima and to go to Gant. Update Gobi's armor and weapons 
and head south and go up to land and head north to a town. 

******** 
**Gant**
********
Items: HrGlas, A.Potion, L.Potion, Goods
Level: 15 (Gobi)
New Weapons/Armor: Yes
Go up to the house in the way north and talk to the person in there to 
get Goods to deliver to Prima. Nothing much else to do, but maybe 
update your weapons and getting all the items. After you are done 
getting all the items and stuff, head outside and go back to Prima.

********* 
**Prima**
*********
Give the goods to the Guild Master and he will give you the gills in 
return for his appreciation. Then you will hear explosions coming from 
above the town. Go upstairs and you will see the "Grim Reaper" standing 
over a Bull-like creature. Gobi will then say that he will get heroes 
that can defeat the creature. Head out and go to the island where the 
others are stuck. Then head back to Prima. Head into the inn and go 
upstairs if you want to start the boss fight. Before you engage the 
boss fight, you should upgrade your equipment and maybe get a few 
levels outside. Once you think you are ready go up and start the boss 
fight.

********** 
**Morteo**
**********
I suggest having Ryu, Nina, Bo and Gobi. First cast Fort on everybody 
but Ryu. Then have Nina cast attack up on Bo and Gobi. Ryu should turn 
into the flame dragon, for the fact that Mortea is an undead boss and 
will be weaker against fire attacks. Have Ryu attack normally, Nina 
attack or heal when necessary. Bo should use Fry and attack when he 
runs out of AP. Gobi should use his magic and after his AP runs out, he 
should attack. This boss fight isn't too hard at all.
EXP: 3850
Gold: 3300

Ox will wake up after you defeat Morteo and decide to join your party. 
He will explain his situation to your party and they decide to help him 
out. You can now reach several places that you were not able to go 
before. If you think back to some places where there were rocks then 
you should go back to and break the rocks with Ox and get the treasure. 
In the next update I will write all the things that you should get with 
Ox in your group.

Now is the time to level up. Head outside of Prima and defeat the 
enemies here to gain lots of experience. I suggest getting everybody to 
at least level 24 by now. The more levels you get, it will get much 
easier later on. 

This is the required part of the game. You must head back to the Krypt 
where you found Karn before. There break the rock containing the B. 
Rang and then head back out and go to Prima. After you get the B. Rang 
head back to Prima and prepare to enter the fortress. You must head 
left from Prima and head south to a pretty big castle.

************ 
**Fortress**
************ 
Items: 2 Herb, Giant HR, Echo HaT, Metal Shield, Life 
Level: 25
This place is not confusing. Have Ox in the front so he can break down 
walls or rocks to make your way easier. The monsters in here give 
pretty good experience and none are hard. Just keep heading the way you 
are going and soon you will have to face a boss fight.

******** 
**Toad**
********
Right when this battle starts, have Nina cast FortX if she is high 
enough level to get it, or else just cast Fort on everyone but Ryu. 
Have Ryu turn into a Thunder Dragon and regularly attack. Ox should 
just attack regularly and Nina after casting Attack up on Karn and Ox 
should heal or attack. The Toad is really fast so make sure that you 
heal when they lost about half of your party member's life. This battle 
is not too hard, just make sure to heal. 
EXP: 6000 
Gold: 1500

They will talk about how some prisoners were taken to some fortress. 
You have to talk to an old man living near there and he will give you 
some advice. Warp back to Gant and head along the shores to your right 
until you see a hut. Enter in and the old man will notice you have the 
B. Rang and there is a person in Gant who can fix it. Talk to the guy 
in the house way in the back and he will fix the B. Rang for you. Head 
back to the old man and he will give you advice. Make sure to equip the 
B. Rang on Ryu. The old man will talk about some Grim Fowl who is 
usually calm unless its eggs are taken. He tells you to use that 
strategy as a weapon. Anyway head back to the Fortress and head out and 
go straight north. 

You will enter a group of trees and you will see birds everywhere. If 
you walk near the middle you will see a purple dotted egg. Once you 
touch it a boss fight will occur so I suggest you heal before engaging 
the battle.

************* 
**Grim Fowl**
************* 
Use Fort on everyone or FortX if you are high enough level. Then have 
Nina cast attack up on Ox and Karn. Ryu should turn into a Snow Dragon, 
because the bird is weak against ice attacks. Have Karn and Ox attack 
regularly and same with Ryu. Nina should attack or heal when necessary. 
This battle can be a bit tough, but it is not the hardest boss fight in 
the game.
EXP: 5053
Gold: 5775

You will then take the egg and the whole flock of Grim Fowls will 
follow you. Head north with the egg and make sure you don't move too 
fast or else the idiotic birds will not be able to keep up. You will 
throw the egg in the castle and that will allow you to enter it. You 
will see a whole lot of mayhem ;).

**************** 
**Nabal Castle**
****************
Items: Skull RG, Life2
Level: 25
Make sure to get the items and just navigate yourself through this 
small castle. Head downstairs, then to the south west direction and you 
will need to break down the wall with Ox. Enter and the General will 
say something about how he doesn't have time to deal with us and sends 
his little helpers to try and stop us. Get ready for another boss fight 
and this fight is with the SlimeX.

********** 
**SlimeX**
********** 
God those things look like bobbing jellos. Anyway back to the point. 
Start this out like any other boss fight. Have Nina use FortX and Karn 
and Ox regularly attack. Then cast attack up on Karn and Ox and have 
her heal and attack. Ryu should turn into a Flame Dragon and after you 
defeat these slimes, they will enter their second wind. They will turn 
into a huge slime that hits harder then the previous 3. Just use the 
strategy above and the ugly slime should die pretty soon.
EXP: 6496  
Gold: 7218

After the battle, you will save the prisoners, but before they die the 
General's Helpers will inform you that Prima will be destroyed. The 
ship will sail off and you will be transported back to Prima. The Guild 
Owner will say that the party will need the wisdom of the Wisdon 
Sorceress (catchy phrase). You will then have to warp to Arad and enter 
the little town that keeps moving. 

********** 
**Wisdon**
********** 
Items: 2 Herb, 2 Pro Shield, 2 Life, Life2, Old SP, Silver BR, Rage HR, 
Chain Mail, OldEgg
Level: 26
New Weapons/Armor: No
I would save before going underneath to where the sorceress lies, 
because there will be some pretty hard boss fights coming up. All the 
buildings will be closed off except the dragon shrine. Find your way 
through the dungeon getting all the items and when you reach a healing 
spring, recover your hit points and engage the spirits to start a boss 
fight. When you enter the room where you see a sleeping mermaid like 
woman talk to the spirits in front of her and 3 boss fights will occur.

********
**Wisp**
********
Remember this guy from way back. Well he is back and you have to fight 
him. He will be the same as the time when you fought him in Agua. You 
should easily dispose of him without using any magic or spells. Just 
regularly attack him and he will die really fast.
EXP: 1560
Gold: 990

********* 
**Cloud**
*********
This boss is a bit harder then the previous one. I would turn Thunder 
Dragon here and cast attack up on Karn and Ox. Fort is not necessary, 
because Cloud will not use physical attacks. Get rid of this boss 
quickly or else he will use his devastating spells to destroy your 
party. You fought him before and the only difference is that he has 
more HP. This boss fight shouldn't be too hard at all.
EXP: 3239 
Gold: 2306 
 
******** 
**Myst** 
********
Myst is a lot like Cloud. Myst will not use physical attacks so don't 
worry about casting fort. Instead first cast attack up on Karn and Ox 
then cast Shield on the whole party. Ryu should turn into the Thunder 
Dragon and Nina should heal after casting all her spells. This boss 
fight is the hardest of the three and you should be careful because 
this guy has some deadly spells at his disposal.
EXP: 4812 
Gold: 4331

After Bleu wakes up the ghosts will go away and she will give you an 
oldegg and tells you to put the egg in a volcano so it will hatch. She 
will then scold you for being rude and waking her up. She will 
immediately go back to sleep after giving you the egg and you must 
continue on your way back to Prima and head north from Prima to a cave 
where the volcano lies.

***************** 
**Volcano Ocean**
***************** 
Items: Herb, M. Drop, Sharp Bow, 5000 GP, Power DR
Level: 27
Start to navigate your way through this little cave. It is very 
difficult to navigate. Just go in a northerly direction. Take the 
stairs north and soon you will reach the volcano. Go to the middle and 
down the ledge and press A. Ryu will drop the Egg into the volcano and 
it will hatch. 

After you put in the egg, you will be instantly transported to Bleu and 
she will join your party for good. This is great, Bleu has great, great 
offensive magic. Immediately take out Ox and put her in the back row. 
She is awesome. She will be the only offensive magic sorceress in your 
whole party for the rest of the game. I highly suggest training her as 
from now the walkthrough will include her.

The Dark Dragons will make their move first and start to invade. You 
get on a huge fish and start to make your way to counter their attack. 
You will surface and be surrounded by ships, but Bleu will summon the 
huge bug from the egg and it will begin to destroy half of the ships. 
The enemy will retreat and you will go back into the water and get off 
the big fish. Head north and talk to the General to start another boss 
fight.

*********** 
**Pincher**
*********** 
This boss is pretty tough. First have Nina use FortX then cast Shield 
on everyone. She should then cast attack up on Karn and then heal if 
necessary. Bleu should use Fry and Ryu should turn into the Thunder 
Dragon and begin to attack. Using this strategy, this boss should fall 
pretty quickly. 
EXP: 6243 
Gold: 6243

The General will threaten to take everyone with him. He will then self-
destruct and that will end the threat so far. After that battle, there 
will be a little cinema scene where Jade and Zog are discussing their 
plan. Jade will then send his four captains to destroy you. The guild 
owner of Prima will congratulate you. Head back into Prima and talk to 
him to receive the Sphere. This is required to continue the game. 
Outside, put Gobi in front of your party and press A. You will then 
turn into a big fish. Head northwest and go through the black space. 

Ok its time to get some more Dragon spells for Ryu, but it's a 
complicated process. This is what you have to do. First with Gobi, swim 
near an island in the middle and enter it. Head into the castle and 
upgrade your weapons/armor if you need it. Go upstairs and try to get 
the treasure, but the statues will throw you down. (Try to get the 
treasure at the left) Once you are downstairs move the box near the bed 
and search the spot. You will get a Rod5. Exit out of the Tunlan and 
warp to Romero. From there have Shin/Bo in front of your party and head 
in a west direction until you see a well. Make sure you have some 
fishing bait. Equip the Rod5 and the fishing bait to Ryu and fish out 
the Dragon Sword.

From here you must go back to the Fortress. From the Fortress go left 
and not north from there. You will soon reach a Dragon Shrine. Get 
ready for another 1 on 1 boss fight and be ready for some brand new 
powerful Dragon Spells. Heal at the Spring and talk to the green dragon 
thingey and start the fight.

******** 
**Bain**
******** 
Start this fight by turning into a Thunder Dragon and then just beat 
the crap out of the blue bird. Its not hard at all if you are a decent 
level. You will learn 4 new spanking nice Dragon spells
EXP: 1020
Gold: 640

Warp back to Tunlan and head back into the ocean. Turn into the big 
fish and head north west until you see a beach then press A to revert 
back. You will need to head to Gust next and if you went to the 
northwest direction and came out, you should see a dragon sign. This 
means that you are on the right track. Head northeast to a town. 

******** 
**Gust**
******** 
Items: Sash
Level: 27
New Weapons/Armor: Yes
Once you enter this town, you will see people start running around 
stupidly. Upgrade your equipment and in one of the houses you can fall 
down and get one of Karn's Transformation spells. Get ready for some 
tough battles up ahead, so level around the area if you have to, or 
after you are done head north. Debo is the transformation you will 
learn when you talk to the old man, but it's also his worst. It only 
works underwater and you will rarely now ever go back there. Anyways 
head north and go in the door.

*************** 
**Fortress #2**
***************
Items: 2 Herb, L. Potion, Cure2, Rod4, M. Cura
Level: 27
If you try to get the treasure chests, you have to fight a huge beast. 
If you are high levels (27+) then I suggest you just regularly attack. 
They give lots of experience and gold, but they deal pretty decent 
damage. If you are a pretty low level, then treat this battle like a 
boss fight. Other then that I would fight all of it. Once you head 
upstairs, a weird looking monk guy will come and try out his new 
"formula". Your whole party will turn miniature size and you have to 
find a hole somewhere in the wall to proceed.  
 
Once you continue on you will see a little colony of mice. You can rest 
at the "mice" inn if you want. Talk to all the mice and then talk to 
the one guarding the doorway and he will move. Get ready to fight a 
whole lot of roaches. Disgusting creatures. **Shakes Head** No offense 
to all you roach lovers out there ;).

**************
**3 K. Roach**
**************
This is a pretty easy boss fight. The roaches are very weak against 
physical attacks. If you got the Dragon Sword like you should by now, 
then just regularly attack, because you will do more damage that way. 
If Karn is morphed to Shin, then he will do major damage. Have Bleu use 
her strongest magic and have Nina first cast FortX then attack up on 
everyone. Then just heal and attack whenever necessary. This fight 
should be over quickly.
EXP: 1380 
Gold: 600

Head back to the mice village and the Chief in return for his gratitude 
will give you the antidote to turn you back to normal size. (I wonder 
how he got it)...  Anyway Ryu will go outside and use the potion to 
turn back. Hurry down the stairs into a room similar to that in Agua. 
The monsters in here give tons of EXP. Great place to level up if you 
need it. Get ready for a really hard boss fight. 

********* 
**RugaX**
********* 
Start this boss fight off with Nina casting FortX on everyone. Have Ryu 
turn into the Bolt Dragon and have Shin (aka Karn) attack. Have Bleu 
use her strongest magic. Nina should then cast attack up on Shin and 
then heal and attack as needed. Keep this strategy up and this boss 
should fall soon. She packs a decent punch so be very careful and heal 
quickly. Make sure you are a pretty high level so you will not have too 
much trouble. This monster has no second wind.
EXP: 4126 
Gold: 3121

Cort will inform you that his flowers will destroy everything. RugaX 
was really a human and she is in critical condition. Bleu says she 
can't heal her, unless she has some oil. Next quest is the quest for 
the oil. (Yea I know boring title). Bleu rudely pushes you out, I might 
add... (Rude woman)... Anyway head back into Gust heal at the inn and 
prepare for the weirdest boss fight you have encountered so far. You 
have to kill a giant fly. Head into the cave at northwest corner. 

************* 
**Giant Fly**
************* 
This fly is a big trouble. It is very fast and will probably be the 
first to strike. Have Ryu turn into a Bolt Dragon. Shin should attack 
and so should Ox. Nina should cast FortX and attack up on Shin and Ox 
then after that just heal everyone when needed. This battle might be 
hard, but if you are a decent level then it is manageable. 
EXP: 7284 
Gold: 8325

Pick up the Giant Fly and heal at the inn and head back into the water. 
Have Gobi in the front turn into a Big Fish and proceed in a south-east 
direction. You will see something like this then you know you are 
there.

Yea, yea I Know he drawing sucks, but it's the best I could do ;). 
Anyway get back on land and go into the frog cave. After you exchange 
the Giant Fly for the Oil, warp back to Gust and give the Oil to Bleu. 
Heal at the inn and get ready to fight some very nasty flowers. Head 
back north to where you saw the flowers last time. Make sure to 
transform Karn into Shin.

*********** 
**FlowerX**
*********** 
This boss is not very hard. Just have Nina cast FortX on everyone. Then 
have Ryu turn into the Bolt Dragon, Shin should attack and so should 
Ox. Nina should then cast attack up on Shin and Ox and then heal and 
attack whenever she is necessary. This fight is easy enough, and if you 
are having trouble then I suggest leveling up a bit.
EXP: 3850 
Gold: 3609

Head back to Gust and go into the house where Bleu was last time. Make 
sure to refuse into Shin before you engage RugaX for the second time. 
Once you enter, you will see RugaX running rampage around the house and 
so you must destroy it. 

********* 
**RugaX**
********* 
Start this boss fight off with Nina casting FortX on everyone. Have Ryu 
turn into the Bolt Dragon and have Shin (aka Karn) attack. Have Bleu 
use her strongest magic. Nina should then cast attack up on Shin and 
then heal and attack as needed. Keep this strategy up and this boss 
should fall soon. She packs a decent punch so be very careful and heal 
quickly. Make sure you are a pretty high level so you will not have too 
much trouble. This monster has no second wind.
EXP: 4162 
Gold: 3121

In return for his appreciation, your former enemy RugaX (aka Nicholie) 
will fix the bridge. You will be healed automatically. Make Karn into 
Shin again and then head to bridge. It is northwest of Gust and be 
prepared for the hardest boss fight you had a in a long time. That last 
hardest one was when you had to fight Gremlin. 

************ 
**Horntoad**
************
Start this fight like any other boss fight. Ryu should turn into a Bolt 
Dragon, Shin should attack and Bleu should use her strongest magic. 
Have Nina cast FortX and attack up on Shin. Then have her heal for most 
of the battle, because you are going to need it. This boss is pretty 
easy the first wind, but at his second wind, he will start to hit the 
whole party, so watch out. If you are really getting beat up use the 
Water Jar that you have saved up and you should come out the winner of 
the battle. Make sure to always have a Water Jar full in case of 
emergencies like this fight.
EXP: 6800 
Gold: 7000

After this relatively easy boss fight head west from the bridge until 
you see a mole sticking her head out of a hole and goes back in. Follow 
her in to a mole town.

********** 
**Gramor**
**********
Items: Cowl 
Level: 28
New weapons/armor: No
Nothing much to do in this town. Just head into one of the houses and 
talk to the mole standing next to a mole on a bed and answer yes to her 
question and you will receive a cowl. Its time to head back to Tunlan.

********** 
**Tunlan**
**********
Go up to the castle to talk to the princess and you will find out that 
she wants to give a key to the Dark Dragons. You will need the Cowl and 
the Maestro to talk to her. (The Maestro is in Gust under an old man's 
bed.) Talk to the woman in green and she will tell you to talk to the 
princess in the room above. Go up the stairs and talk to the woman 
standing and she will tell you that she will not give you the Tm Key. 
Head back downstairs and talk to the old woman. The old lady says 
something about the marks on her back showing something. Follow her.

Ok now go talk to the old lady again in front of the statues. She will 
tell you the princess likes to swim at night. Head back up the stairs. 
Now go back outside and use Ryu's spell to turn the day into night. 
Head back into the castle. Go back to where the old lady. Talk to her 
and head back up the stairs. Now on the left side of the wall in this 
room there is a small crack in which you can squeeze through. Go left 
and up and head into the palm trees. 

The princess will have marks on her back. The colors are in this order. 
Blue, red, and white from left to right. The guards will come and enjoy 
the little brawl. I thought it was comical. This ends when Bleu uses 
her spells... and the party ends up in bed. Go back up the stairs to 
retrieve the bolster. Now return to Gramor.

**********************
**Mogu's Dream World**
********************** 
Talk to the sleeping mole to enter his dream using the bolster. You 
will end up in a peculiar town. You can't buy weapons, but the only 
thing you can do is rest at the inn and stock up on items. Once you 
feel your ready head out and head north to a tower. I suggest you level 
up at the tower, because the monsters there give great experience and 
it will help greatly. Find your way across this maze until you get to 
Mothro. You can not beat him so there is no point in fighting him. Just 
talk to him and then head back out. You will find out that someone 
found Mogu's courage. Head south west to a gas field. This is where 
Mogu's courage lies.

************* 
**Gas Field**
*************
Items: Headgear, Life, Light Shield

Just work your way through this gas field. It should be self 
explanatory. Once you get in the cave you will find that Mogu's courage 
is there. Talk to him and then everyone will join with the courage to 
form one whole Mogu. Now you can beat Mothro. Head back to the inn to 
heal and then head up to the tower once more.

Work your way up each floor. It seems complicated but just use your 
logic to figure it out. There are 3 floors and once you get to the last 
one you should be able to find Mothro there. Once you see him get ready 
for a boss fight. Talk to him and then a boss fight will ensue.

********** 
**Mothro**
**********
Mothro will have very little life to start. Do not let this confuse or 
fool you. He is still very hard and there is enough hit points left in 
him to give you trouble. Have Nina cast FortX and then have her heal. 
Ryu should turn into a Bolt Dragon and have Shin attack normally. Have 
Bleu use her strongest magic. Mothro has very high evade so he will 
dodge most of your attacks. Just keep this up and he will fall. 

Mogu will then wake up and then he decides to join your party. Mogu's 
special ability is to dig. This is not a bad way to get some pretty 
good items. The next section will cover what you can get.

Head to Camlon and head along the road until you see a dragon in a 
circle on the ground. This is a dig spot. Have Mogu dig and then you 
will fall in a room. Have Karn in your party out in front and he will 
learn his next transformation Doof. This will let you move dressers.

In one of the houses in Bleak there is a place where there is a dresser 
and 2 jars. Move the dresser and search the area to find a ClearCL. 
This is a great armor for Nina or Bleu. Head north of that dresser and 
move the dresser there and head down. There Karn will learn his last 
transformation Puka. This is the best one in my opinion.

Head to Auria and go north. When you see an emblem use Puka to move it 
and head in to claim the Dark Bracelet.

Go to Gust and head south and use Puka to move the emblem and get the 
love bracelet. 

Now finally head to Gramor and when you see some strange trees have 
Mogu dig there and you will get a root. This is important later so keep 
it and don't forget to do that.

To the south of Gramor head into the cave and continue to the town of 
Spring.

********** 
**Spring**
********** 
Items: Herb/Clog
Level: 30's
Nothing much to do here except to upgrade your armor and weapons and to 
stock up on items. Once you are done head out and head southwest to the 
Spyre tower. I suggest to get a few levels outside of Spring also. It 
will help very soon.

*************** 
**Spyre Tower**
***************
Items: Cure2, Flame Armor, Shell, World Armor, A. Potion
Level: 30's

The beginning is like any dungeon. Just make your way upstairs and each 
step you go up has a different little setting. There are clouds, grass 
etc. Just make your way up and fight a few more battles to get your 
levels up and when you reach the last pillar get ready to go through 
another dream world... Search the pillar and Mote will appear and hurl 
you into a dream world.

********************** 
**Second Dream World**
**********************
Items: Cure, L. Potion, Jade Bow, Trident, Cursed Hat, Smoke, Facemask
Level: 30's

Head north to a cave and make your way upstairs. It's not that 
complicating in the first few floors. Just get all the items, because 
they are worth it. Then keep going the right way and you will meet up 
with Mote's conscience. Up ahead of that is the hardest part of the 
game. Its not a boss fight, it's not a fight at all, it's the most 
confusing maze. This game has very easy dungeons, but this maze is very 
hard. I will give a step-be-step guide on how to pass it. This wills 
probably the only place where I will give such detailed information.

From the first switch, head to the left, and follow the path to the 
next switch.  Now follow the path to the south, and you'll soon come to 
another switch. From this switch head to the north, and you should come 
upon the fourth switch. 
Step on that switch, and after the room stops spinning follow the path 
to the east, and take the first south, and then continue to the east, 
and follow that path till it branches south again, and then head south 
and you'll come to yet another switch. 
Step on that switch and make the room spin again, then head to the 
left. Keep going left and then you'll come to another switch. After the 
room is done spinning, head to the left again. Keep going left until 
you come to the second north. Keep going from here for the final 
teleport. Go left for the last teleport.

Take the middle staircase and in the lower right hand corner of the 
room is where you will find a pit fall. Head up the stairs. On the 
fourth floor there will be lots of purple tiles. Make sure that you 
revert Karn if he is transformation and have him lead the party so you 
can spot holes. Find the stairs and head up. Take the right and the 
stairs way to the south to initiate another boss fight.

******** 
**Mote**
********
Do not do use any spells or moves until Mote's Conscience shows up or 
else you will just be wasting your energy. Ok once his conscience shows 
up use FortX with Nina. Have Bleu cast her strongest magic. Puka should 
attack regularly. Ryu should use Bolt Dragon. Also use attack up on 
Puka. Ok Mote is different from other bosses. If you hit him with a 
physical attack then he will be resistant against physical and weak 
against magic. Magic will affect him the same way as the physical 
except he will gain a resistance to magic. So keep attacking and using 
magic to change his order. With this strategy you really can't lose.
EXP: 5400
Gold: 6000

Ok after this boss fight ends you will end up in the Spyre Tower. Head 
back outside and go to Spring. It is now spring and not winter in the 
town so you can continue the journey behind the waterfall. I also 
suggest fishing for the dragon armor here as it will enable you to 
receive the next Dragon ability.

Head back into the waterfall and head into another cave. Don't worry 
its short. Just head out of the cave and south of it to enter the next 
town.

********** 
**Carmen**
**********
Items: RubyBR, White Antler
Level: 30's
This town has another weird problem. It seems that everyone is frozen 
and turned into stone, but its not quite that bad. For everyone living 
in that town time has stopped. Now it is your job to free the town of 
their troubles. 

Before we go into the next dungeon field, let's get some nice items for 
some of your characters. Head north of the Tock tower and dig with Mogu 
to pick up the Hero Bow. This is the strongest bow in the game for Bo. 
Next head to a Dragon Emblem to pick up the Wind Bracelet. This is not  
bad accessory at all. 

************** 
**Tock Tower**
**************
Items: Cure, Gold Tiara, Icy Armor, Life, Agile Hat, Wolfskin, Life2, 
Guard Shield, Evil CN
Level: 31+
This tower has some strange arrows on tiles. These are basically 
teleporting arrows. Each one will teleport you to a specific area. This 
area is not too difficult to figure out so I suggest you try and figure 
it out for yourself. I mean after all what is the point of playing a 
game if you can't figure out a few things for yourself. The fireheads 
in this cave gives lots of experience so feel free to level up. 

Make your way up to the top of the tower. You will meet Cerl and then 
she will show you the power of the Time Key. You will step into the 
huge black circle and be headed to somewhere. You will end up with only 
the Hero and this can be dangerous because the enemies can overpower 
you. If you die you will just end up in Carmen. Anyway make your way to 
Carmen. 

You will meet Alan. He will talk about Cerl and blah blah. Head back up 
the tower. I hope you know your way. Cerl will then kick you out once 
more. A fight will occur but you can't beat her so don't bother trying. 
Head back to Carmen by warping with Nina. Alan will talk about how its 
all his fault and a fruit might help her remember. Have Ox hit the 
fruit tree where you ended up the first time to receive the fruit. Head 
to the south castle where you will confront Cerl once again. 

Cerl will tell you to take the key and leave. That is when Goda 
appears. You will then be transported to the Tock Tower once more. 
There Nina will try to put in the key but something will go wrong like 
always. Nina will then be pulled into the black hole. Your going to 
miss her magic for a while. 
 
You will end up outside of Tunlan. Have Ox punch the tree for a C. Nut 
as you will need it later. Now head into Tunlan. Go into one of the 
houses where you will see Nina in a different color outfit. Talk to her 
and she won't know who you are. Talk to the old lady in the room and 
she will talk about some famous doctor who can help her. Now head 
outside and warp to Carmen. (Hint: Use Bleu)

********** 
**Carmen**
**********
Meet the new Carmen with the time restored. First head into the weapons 
shop and buy the best equipment available as they will be the best you 
will have for a while. Now head into the north east house and talk to 
the doctor. He will tell you the ingredients you need. You should have 
the C. Nut, Root and a W. Ant already. The rest are easier to get. Just 
head south of the South Castle where Cerl and Alan was and you will 
reach a broken bridge. Fish here for the poisoned fish. Make sure you 
have some bait and a rod. If you need bait head to Auria to buy some.

After you are done getting those items, head back to the doctor and he 
will make the tonic for you. After you receive the tonic head back to 
Tunlan and give it to Nina. She has some new abilities and she is a bit 
older. She can now fly. To use it just have her in front of your party 
and press A.

Now is the time to do some final things before we fight the boss. Hope 
your characters have high enough levels to take on the bad dark 
dragons.

First warp to Arad then have Nina fly way south of Arad to a place 
where you can fish. Then you can get the Dragon helmet. It's to the 
southwest and in a broken well. You shouldn't have too much trouble 
finding it.

The next item to get is the Dragon Shield. First warp to Gramor. Then 
in a well in between some mountains fish to receive the shield. Now you 
are ready to get one of the powerful dragon fusions. As you can see 
these Dragon items are very powerful. Now head to Gust and go to the 
castle in the middle of the lake. Now get ready to fight 1 on 1 with 
the hero. 

********* 
**Avion**
********* 
Just turn into a Bolt Dragon and pummel him. Heal if you have to, but 
by now you should be powerful enough to just finish him off. This is 
not a real hard boss fight so don't take it too seriously. After you 
beat this you get the all powerful Rudra Fusion. 
EXP: 1400
Gold: 1600

Head to Romero to obtain the ultimate Fusion. Head to the Cleansing 
Cave. Now head all the way to where you filled the jar last time. You 
will find a room below the place where you could fill the jar if you 
have all the dragon equipment. You will then meet the dragon and obtain 
the ultimate spell Agni. It will basically fuse all your characters 
into 1 super dragon and no matter what it will do 999 damage to all 
your opponents. This should help you a lot in the future boss fights.

Warp back to Romero and head a little north to see a demented looking 
castle. Search the back of it to receive the Tri-Rang. It's the best 
weapon available so far for Ryu. First go to Carmen and in the 
northeast of the village there is a cloaked man. Talk to him and he 
search where he was to receive the Pass. It's a key item so don't 
forget to get it. Ok now head for Scande. It's south of Carmen.  

********** 
**Scande**
**********
Items: Power Hat, Icy CN, Marble 1, Glove, Cure
Level: 31+
From here you really can't do much except find the items. Just head 
back out and go to Spring to get some needed climbing gear. In one of 
the houses in Spring talk to one of the guys to get the broken parts to 
climb the tower. Now head for Gant and have the guy in the north house 
fix it for you. Now its time to head back to Scande to climb the tower 
and face some of the elite bosses this game has to offer. (If the guy 
in Spring doesn't give you the parts go back to Scande and talk to 
everyone.)

Ok now put the parts into the elevator and you can start going up. When 
you reach the top you will meet the cloaked character again. He will 
talk about the Dragon Heart. Now in order to get this powerful item we 
must head to Tunlan. (This item will make any dragon's hp turn into 1. 
I suggest not using it on Zog, but save it for Sara.)

In a house in Tunlan a lady will play the Dragon Heart and Ryu will 
feel disturbed. If you look at his hit points you will find out that 
its 1. Save this for future bosses. Anyway leave Tunlan and head back 
to Scande to face Zog. I suggest refilling your Water Jar also. You 
might need it. Now when you head up the tower that cloaked figure will 
be gone.

Make your way through until you get to Zog. It may be complicating, but 
hey you must have done this at least 12 times before. This should be 
easy enough.

******* 
**Zog**
*******
You have 2 options here. You can either use the Dragon Heart or save it 
for the next boss that's much better. If you chose option 2 then you 
have to have the Hero turn into Rudra, have Puka attack and have Nina 
cast her magic and Bleu use BoltX or you can just turn into Agni and 
pound him. Your choice, and overall it's an easy fight.
EXP: 7000 
Gold: 7000

You will meet Sara when you hit the floor. Remember her..., well don't 
feel too happy, because she is a traitor and you will have to fight 
her. Ryu will then give her the remaining Dragon Keys (idiot) and she 
will laugh and run off. They leave for Agua and you are stuck in that 
dungeon. However, the mole people help you out and you are safe for the 
time being...
  
You will end up back in Scande. Rest up and stock up on the items you 
need and then head to Romero and then to Agua. Now on Agua remember 
where you got the Life Armor and all the good stuff earlier in the 
game, well head back up there. That is where you will find the people 
who stole our keys. Good luck navigating yourself through the tower. 

********** 
**Pagoda**
********** 
Items: Power Armor, Domino, Stone Hat, Trap Guard, Agile Armor, Flame 
DR
Level: 35+
This tower is very hard to navigate through. Just do the best you can 
until you reach Sara. Then you will have an easy or hard boss fight 
considering whether you saved the Dragon Heart until now. 

******** 
**Sara**
******** 
Just use the Dragon Heart and then hit her to kill her or else if you 
didn't save it just have the Hero turn into Agni with the rest of them 
and outlast her. Save when needed otherwise just keep it on automatic. 
This is not a really hard boss fight if you saved the Dragon Heart 
though.
EXP: 9999
Gold: 9999

After you defeat Sara continue on your way and don't fall for the trap 
hole. Now the next place will have those buttons where the background 
disappears and reappears etc. Just head south from the entrance and 
continue your way. You should be getting of experience points from this 
area. After you get to the platform just continue to head south from 
it. Don't worry this will soon end. Ignore the second platform and 
continue up the stairs. You will continue somewhere soon. Get ready to 
go to the Obelisk. 

Before you head for the Obelisk you need to retrieve some very 
important items. You are almost done with the game congratulations. 
Warp to Auria and head to house to the north that is disconnected from 
the regular area. Talk to the old lady dressed in red there and she 
will tell you that she is a weapon's collector. Now head to Gant and 
head for the guy that gave you the B. Rang and enter his house to get 
the list. 

Take the list and now head back to her house. Go back to the old lady 
and you will pick up the Wizit or something like that. Now head back to 
the old man. He doesn't think it's a weapon and he wants to study it. 
Now head back and forth until they give you the I. Claw. Now head for 
Gramor and talk to the leader to figure out how to use it. 

Mogu will learn how to use it. The Obelisk is near Scande so head 
there. It's a huge flying fortress. Fly in there and enter the room 
with Mogu in front. He will dig a hole straight down. Just navigate 
your way through until you reach another boss fight. When you see a big 
guy heal up and get ready for a boss fight. 

******** 
**Goda**
******** 
Just use Agni with the combined party and pummel him until its time to 
heal then do so. Just keep doing this over again until he dies. It 
should last around 15 rounds so make sure you can heal. This is not too 
big of a boss fight.
EXP: 6000 
Gold: 6000

Now head down the stairs and you will see 4 platforms. It doesn't 
matter which one you choose as each will lead you to the same area. Now 
in this area just work your way around until you meet Jade. He is tough 
and the second to last boss you will face.

******** 
**Jade**
******** 
Jade is quite easy to beat because you have to just outlast him. Just 
use Agni and like above start attacking then heal when necessary. Once 
you get Agni the game gets quite a bit easy. 
EXP: 8000
Gold: 8000

Now take the platform to where the Tyr is. When she asks if you came 
for a wish say yes and she will heal you. Now talk to her again and say 
no and then you will have to fight her. Just pummel her as she won't 
attack you. You will get kicked out of battle and she will ask if they 
would like to be friends. Say yes and Sara will come and warn you. Now 
when you fight her use Agni. She will freak out and you get kicked out 
of battle again. Now is the real fight.

*************** 
**Goddess Tyr**
*************** 
Use the same strategy as the one you used for Jade. She has a little 
more experience. If you don't use Agni to kill her then you will get 
the bad ending. It's easier to beat her with Agni anyway. Just keep 
attacking and then when you need to heal revert and fuse once more. 
This fight can last quite a while, but don't worry with Agni you will 
win. Once you are done then you won. 
 
CONGRATULATIONS YOU HAVE BEATEN BREATH OF FIRE. ENJOY THE ENDING.
